        <ol>
          <li>Diagnostic Precision: Every repair begins with component-level inspection using advanced diagnostic tools to isolate root causes — not symptoms. This ensures lasting results and prevents recurring faults.</li>
          <li>Quality Components Only: All replacements and upgrades use tested OEM-grade parts sourced for reliability and durability. Zero shortcuts, zero counterfeit parts.</li>
          <li>Transparent Process: Clients receive clear repair summaries, cost breakdowns, and timelines before any work begins — maintaining full visibility and trust throughout the process.</li>
          <li>Post-Repair Verification: Every repaired device undergoes full functional testing, heat profile analysis, and performance validation to confirm integrity before handover.</li>
        </ol>
